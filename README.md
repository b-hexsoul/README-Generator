    # Brandon's New Project

    ## Description
    This is a repo to describe this project because it is awesome. This project creates an awesome readme file. Next Ill be putting all my focus into OOP with Javascript. This is fundamental for my growth and learning and to future projects I take on. I need to dive deep into this and give it my all.
